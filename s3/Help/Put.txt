*s3 put <bucket>[/<keyprefix>] <path> [/big[:<size>]] [/backup] 
        [/sync] [/acl:<acl>] [/sub[:withdelete]] [/yes] [/key:<key> /secret:<secret>]
		[/storageclass:<storageclass>]

Examples:
s3 put mybucket pic*.jpg /acl:public-read
s3 put mybucket/pictures/ c:\mypictures\ /sub:withdelete /sync

    Puts the file(s) specified by the path to S3.  Wildcards are supported.
    The filename excluding path is suffixed to the end of the supplied key 
    prefix, if any.

    /big splits files into 10MB chunks suffixed with .000, .001 etc.  This is
    done without creating any temporary files on disk.  A custom chunk size 
    can be specified in MB, e.g. /big:0.1 creates chunks of about 100KB.

    /backup causes only files with the archive attribute to be copied, and the
    archive attribute is reset after copying (Windows only).

    /sync only uploads files that do not exist on S3 or have been modified
    since last being uploaded.  It can be used alone or in conjunction with the
    /sub option for a fast incremental backup of a whole directory.

    /acl sets the ACL.  To make files public use /acl:public-read

    /sub copies an entire directory hierarchy.  The keyprefix must be absent or
    end with a slash (/), and the path can be an existing directory.  The
    /sub:withdelete option does the same but also deletes keys on S3 that start
    with the given keyprefix (if provided) but don't correspond to a local
    file.

    /yes surpresses prompting on each delete with the /sub:withdelete option.
    
    /key & /secret allow the Amazon S3 access key and secret key to be passed
    on the command line (even if auth has previously been used).
    
    /nogui disables the graphical progress window.

    /storageclass specifies the storage class which S3 should store this object
    under.  Valid classes at time of writing are STANDARD (default) or 
    REDUCED_REDUNDANCY (see S3 documentation for more details).
