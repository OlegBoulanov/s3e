*s3 get <bucket>/<keyprefix> [<path>] [/big] [/sub] [/key:<key> /secret:<secret>]

Examples:
s3 get mybucket/pic*
s3 get mybucket/pictures/ /sub
    
    Gets the specified object(s) from S3. If no filename is supplied then the
    suffix of the key after the final slash is used as the filename, except
    with the /sub option (see below).

    A trailing * on the end of the key is treated as a wildcard, except when 
    the /big option or a full <filename> is specified.

    /big fetches a file or files split using /big with the put command.

    /sub causes all keys beginning with the specified keyprefix to be fetched
    and forward slashes (/) in the key names used to create directories as
    needed.  This enables a whole directory hierarchy uploaded with 'put /sub' 
    to be downloaded.
    
    /key & /secret allow the Amazon S3 access key and secret key to be passed
    on the command line (even if auth has previously been used).
    
    /nogui disables the graphical progress window.
